    "Just like we observed in the last notebook, here we can see that the goalscorer made a really good run between the opposition defenders. The player who provided the assist also waited and released the ball at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look carefully, you can also notice at 0:01 that when the goalscorer receives the ball, he waits with it to draw the opposition defenders' attention to him. You will also see that due to this, the defender covering the player who finally made the assist, leaves his man and moves to defend the goalscorer. This event, no matter how small, took pressure off of the player who got the assist. This is the exact moment (at 0:03) when the goalscorer passed to his eventual assister. The defender who initially covered the assister now shifts his focus back to the assister. This is exactly when the goalscorer made the run behind that defender. This was indeed a display of an intelligent play. It requires proper understanding and communication among the players involved. Also, taking pressure on yourself so that you buy your teammates a little bit of time and space is a skill that requires a lot of practice and experience! Very few players can pull this off."
